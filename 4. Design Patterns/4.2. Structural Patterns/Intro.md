## Structural Patterns:

Structural patterns are used to create a structure of objects that work together to achieve a certain goal. These patterns focus on how the objects are composed to form larger structures, rather than on the behavior of the objects themselves. In general, structural patterns are used to improve the organization of code, reduce complexity, and make code more maintainable. 

In this subchapter, we will discuss the three main types of structural patterns: 

1. Adapter Pattern: This pattern is used to convert the interface of an object into another interface that the client expects. It allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one object with another that adapts the interface to something the client can use. This pattern is useful when you have existing code that you cannot change, but you still need to integrate it with other code. 

2. Bridge Pattern: The bridge pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It allows you to change the implementation of an abstraction without affecting the clients that use it. This pattern is useful when you have a complex system that needs to be broken down into simpler components to make it more manageable. 

3. Composite Pattern: The composite pattern is used to create tree-like structures of objects where individual objects and groups of objects can be treated as the same thing. It allows you to compose objects into a hierarchy to represent part-whole relationships. This pattern is useful when you have a hierarchical structure that you need to represent in code, such as a file system or a company structure. 

Overall, structural patterns are useful when you need to organize code and create structures of objects that work together to achieve a certain goal. By using these patterns, you can make code more maintainable, reduce complexity, and improve the overall design of your software."
