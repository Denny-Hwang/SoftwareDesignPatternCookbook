## Behavioral Patterns:

Behavioral patterns focus on communication and interaction between objects. These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. They provide solutions to common problems that arise in the communication between objects. The following are the different types of behavioral patterns:

1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern: This pattern provides a way to pass a request between a chain of objects until one of them handles the request. This pattern is useful when you want to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver.

2. Command Pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

3. Interpreter Pattern: This pattern provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression. It is used to define a representation for grammar of a given language along with an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language.

4. Iterator Pattern: This pattern provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

5. Mediator Pattern: This pattern provides a way to reduce coupling between objects by encapsulating their interaction in a mediator object. The mediator object allows objects to communicate with each other without being aware of each other's existence.

6. Memento Pattern: This pattern provides a way to capture and restore an object's internal state. It is useful when you need to save and restore the state of an object.

7. Observer Pattern: This pattern provides a way to notify objects of changes to a subject. It is used when you need to maintain consistency between related objects without coupling them.

8. State Pattern: This pattern provides a way to change the behavior of an object when its internal state changes. It is useful when you have an object that has different behavior depending on its state.

9. Strategy Pattern: This pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. It allows you to modify the behavior of an object at runtime.

10. Template Method Pattern: This pattern provides a way to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

In summary, behavioral patterns provide solutions to communication and interaction between objects. They are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects. Understanding these patterns will help you develop better software designs."
