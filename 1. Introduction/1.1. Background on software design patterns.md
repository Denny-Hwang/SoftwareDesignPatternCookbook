## 1.1.1. History of design patterns  
  Design patterns have been around for decades, with the first documented use of the term “design pattern” in the book “Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software” published in 1994 by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, also known as the “Gang of Four.” This book is considered to be the definitive reference on design patterns and is still widely used today. Since then, many other books, articles, and tutorials have been published on the topic of design patterns.
  Before the concept of design patterns, developers had to rely on trial and error to figure out how to solve common software design problems. This often resulted in code that was hard to understand and maintain, and that was not easily reusable. With the advent of design patterns, developers now have a common vocabulary and a set of proven solutions to draw upon when faced with these common software design problems.

## 1.1.2. Importance of design patterns in software development  
  Design patterns are important in software development because they provide a common vocabulary for discussing software design and a set of proven solutions to common problems that arise during the software development process. They can help to make code more maintainable and scalable, as well as reduce the amount of time and effort required to develop new software. Design patterns also promote code reuse and can improve code quality by making it more robust, efficient, and easier to understand.
  For example, when faced with the problem of creating a new object, a developer could use the factory pattern to create a new object without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This allows for flexibility in the code, as the class of object that is created can be changed without affecting the rest of the code. This is an example of how design patterns can make code more maintainable and reusable.
  Another example would be the use of the Singleton pattern. This pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to this instance. This can be useful when there is a single point of control in an application, for example, when you want to limit the number of connections to a database. This pattern can help to make the code more robust, efficient and easier to understand.

## 1.2. Purpose of the handbook  
  The purpose of this handbook is to provide a comprehensive overview of software design patterns and principles. It is intended for software developers, software engineers, data scientists, data engineers, and university students majoring in computer science. The handbook will cover various software principles such as SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, and the Law of Demeter, as well as UML diagrams, and a variety of design patterns including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. It will also include a detailed look at the Model-View-Controller pattern. The handbook will provide examples and code snippets to illustrate the concepts, as well as good and bad code examples to show the proper and improper use of the design patterns.
